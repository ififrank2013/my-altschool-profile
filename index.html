  <!-- Why I Joined AltSchool Section -->
  <h1 align="center">WHY I JOINED ALTSCHOOL AFRICA</h1>
  <p>
    My interest in Software Engineering at AltSchool Africa stems from my desire to enhance my system design and application deployment skills in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.
    My previous and current roles required a deep understanding of cloud-native tools, data architectures, and secure deployments — skills that are core to cloud engineering.
    Through the Cloud Engineering Diploma program at AltSchool, I seek to solidify my knowledge in modern software practices, microservices, Kubernetes, serverless computing,
    and cloud infrastructure, thereby enabling me to build more scalable, resilient, and efficient systems.
    
    The practical and community-driven learning approach at AltSchool aligns perfectly with my professional growth ambitions.
    This program provides me the platform to transition from building data-focused systems to mastering full cloud-based architectures,
    thus becoming a well-rounded engineer capable of leading cloud transformations in any organization.
